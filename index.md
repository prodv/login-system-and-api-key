This project uses Ethereum smart contract for building a simple voting process. Smart contract is created using **Remix IDE** and is deployed on a local blockchain network created using **Ganache CLI**. Interaction with the smart contract is done using **Web3** library through a simple user interface (client side app) as seen above. The list of candidates and the count of votes they have got can be seen below.
